# Documentation
## To see the doc:
Open the docs folder\
`$ cd docs`\
Then\
`$ make html`\
Then\
`$ ./_build/html/index.html`

## To edit the doc:

Documentation files are written in reStructuredText (.rst).
Open and edit these files with your text editor.\
The main page entry is located in the `index.rst` file within the docs folder.

Common reStructuredText directives include:

`.. image:: path/image.png` to add images\
`.. code-block::` to include code snippets\
`.. note::` to add notes or warnings

After making edits, simply run `make html` again to update the documentation with your changes.
